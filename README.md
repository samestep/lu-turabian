LU Turabian
===========

A LaTeX template for [Turabian research papers at Liberty University][guide].
[Such a template][template] already exists [for the School of
Divinity][divinity], but as noted on the website and in the samples, the two
style guides differ. Also, this template uses [a more modern package][package]
for the formatting itself (2018 rather than 2015).
