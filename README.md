LU Turabian
===========

A LaTeX template for [Turabian research papers at Liberty University][guide].
[Such a template][template] already exists [for the School of
Divinity][divinity], but as noted on the website and in the samples, the two
style guides differ. Mr. Surber's template differs from the History department's
sample in these respects:

- The title page is formatted differently. (similar to [#1][i1])
- Page numbering starts on the title page. (like [#2][i2] but a bit worse)
- The Table of Contents is labeled as such, rather than simply "Contents".
- The ToC entries aren't bold. ([#3][i3])
- Footnote numbers are full-size followed by a period, rather than superscript.
  ([#5][i5])

I make use of the lovely [`turabian-formatting` package][package] by Omar
Abdool.
