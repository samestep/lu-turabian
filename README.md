LU Turabian
===========

A LaTeX template for [Turabian research papers at Liberty University][guide].
[Such a template][template] already exists [for the School of
Divinity][divinity], but as noted on the website and in the samples, the two
style guides differ. Mr. Surber's template differs from the History department's
sample in these respects:

- The title page is formatted differently. (similar to #1)
- Page numbering starts on the title page. (like #2 but a bit worse)
- The Table of Contents is labeled as such, rather than simply "Contents".
- The ToC entries aren't bold. (#3)
- Footnote numbers are full-size followed by a period, rather than superscript.
  (#5)
